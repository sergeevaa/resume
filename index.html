        <p>I have been working in QA since 2013. I have experience with e-commerce (e-trade), AI, ML, education projects, products with a high level of secrecy, etc. Furthermore, I'm testing web, mobile (a little), client-server, on-prem, cloud applications. I work with layout, API (Rest and SOAP), console/command line, SQL (MySQL, PSQL, YQL), automatization (JS, Python, a little), Charles (Proxyman, etc.), DB (Postgres, MongoDB, etc.), performance testing (jMeter, a little). I know test-design, test-analysis and use this in my work. Likewise, Iâ€™m writing test plans, test strategy, test cases, checklists, mind map, block-schemes, etc. I conduct demo and acceptance tests for teams and customers.</p>
        <p>Also, I co-author and mentor QA course in Yandex, where we teach people without IT background to be QA junior. And I know what I need to do to my team that they will be better in QA.</p>
        <p>For all my work experience, I have not stopped working with my hands (70-80% of the time)</p>
